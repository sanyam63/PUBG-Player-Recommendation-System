# PUBG-Player-Recommendation-System
Killing the boredom of quarentine by creating this mini project. Read Readme for details.

Based on where you land, how you play, how often do you play and many more criteria, you will be given a list of other players who are like you.
The data set used is small as it was generated from scartch via a google form and thus it may not be perfect and big. It serves it's purpose though.(it ain't much, but it's honest work)

The methodology is based on the concept of Context Based Recommendation System.
This technique attempts to figure out what a user's aspects of gameplay(attributes) is, and then recommends players that are most similar to those aspects.
Select a person from the dataset on whom you want a recomendation made, you can also enter any new data entry, just make sure it's preprocessed like our df dataframe.
